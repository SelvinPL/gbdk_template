### What is it?
It is slighty modified version of original template from GBDK-2020. It is focused on integration with VSCode and Emulicious debugging.

You can easily switch between platforms (for now gb, gbc, sms and gg) and starts debugging with simple `F5` press.

It also fixes most "intellisense's squiggles" problems

### Meant to work with https://github.com/SelvinPL/gb_tools_installer

If you wana use it as standalone template you need to provide environment variables
- `GBDK_HOME` path to gbdk directory
- `EMULICIOUS_PATH` path to Emulicious directory
  
You also need a working `make` tool in your setup on your `PATH`
